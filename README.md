### *Neuroplasticity*

- **Neuroplasticity** is the brain's incredible ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. It's how our brain adapts to experiences, learning, and even recovery from injuries. Essentially, it's the brainâ€™s way of rewiring itself in response to changes in our environment, behavior, thoughts, and emotions.
It plays a crucial role in everything from mastering new skills to overcoming trauma or injury. Whether you're learning a new language or recovering from a stroke, neuroplasticity is at work behind the scenes, shaping and reshaping your brain.

### *How the Brain Grows and Shrinks depending on Environments*

- A study with rats showed that rats confined in two seperate play pens the rats in the big play pen with lots of activities under the microscope showed much larger brains with increased brain function and general well being, they also visibly way more active on a day to day basis compared to simular rats in this study who were also confined  but in a small cage with no interaction and no activites just food and water. ***This was a game changer in Neuro science,*** it showed if we provide the brain with things like new experiences, exercise, going outside, different activities and all round keeping active which also includes things like studying and learning new skills actually increase the size, efficiency and capabilites of the brain, therefore staving off negative outcomes in the brain such as mental health issues.
- Compared with becoming isolated and not doing anything to stimulate the brain, Actually shrinks the brain and hinders new growth taking place, and hinders creation of new neural pathways for a better life. *Moral of the story* - Always keep the brain active and stimulated even if its in the simplest of ways donâ€™t allow yourself to become isolated and not doing anything for periods of time it will contribute to negative outcomes such as deppression, lack of motivation, procrastination, anxiety and other related mental health issues as the brain shrinks. In other words staying couped up inside, isolated and not doing any form of positive brain stimulation is basically like digging yourself a hole and the longer you do it the harder it feels to get out.

### *How to stimulate the brain*

- Try and Challange your self everday in some way weather its physical, social or mental such as doing a completing a quiz, playing a game of chess or working out a coding problem. Mix it up and keep the brain guessing, comfort and famillurality are the enemy to keep pushing through breaking milestones and forming new neural pathways, connects and habits! ðŸš€
